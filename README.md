# regional-covid
Regional Covid is a custom API that focuses on providing local or regional COVID-19 data based on data from https://bing.com/covid

# How The API Works

Once the default country is set, **Total Global** data, **Regional** OR **Local** data is scraped from https://bing.com/covid by Puppeteer and then saved to a Redis Database which is an in-memory data structure store, used as a database, cache and message broker. Redis is *wicked fast* hence the choice of database for this project.

When End-users consume the API which has been set to the default country or region by you(API admin), a cached version of the data is served. Any subsequent visit to the API endpoint also result in a cached version of the data served.
A Cron Job is scheduled to update the Redis Datastore every **hour**(*you can change the update frequency. check the getting started guide below*). Therefore End-users will be served an updated cached version of the data after every hour.

<ins>**Sample JSON Data Served**</ins>

```json
{
   "globalTotalConfirmedCases":"803,313",
   "globalActiveCases":"601,362",
   "globalRecoveredCases":"162,937",
   "globalFatalCases":"39,014",
   "localData":[
      {
         "country":"united states",
         "localTotalConfirmedCases":"174,410",
         "localActiveCases":"165,023",
         "localRecoveredCases":"5,995",
         "localFatalCases":"3,392"
      }
   ],
   "dataLastUpdated":"3/31/2020, 4:36:41 PM"
}
```
<ins>**API Routes**</ins>
1. `/`
2. `/covid/[country]` [country] is the name of your country or region e.g: `/covid/australia`
3. `/covid` redirects to `/`
4. Any other routes apart from the above results in a 404 error

# Motive For This Project

The motive for this project is due to the fact that most API's out there serving COVID-19 data, serve data that is too cluttered and not focused on Local OR Regional data. Recently infomation out there indicates that South Koreans are using apps to avoid someone whoâ€™s had Covid-19 nearby based on local data. 
Local or Regional data will help other developers build data focused applications to help fight the current pandemic.
It's also a way for me to improve upon my skills by learning something new during a self quarantine period. LOL.

Anyone is welcomed to also add features or contribute to this project if you are interested and have the time.

# Getting started

This project is a **[Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/)** application that uses the dependencies **[Express](https://github.com/expressjs/express)**, **[Node Cron](https://github.com/node-cron/node-cron)**, **[Puppeteer](https://github.com/puppeteer/puppeteer)**, and **[Node Redis](https://github.com/NodeRedis/node-redis)**

To get started with the project on your computer locally, set the following Environmental Variables on your computer.

## 1. Setting Environmental Variables

|Environmental Variable| Sample Value |
|--|--|
|COVID_DATA_DB_KEYNAME | covid19_redis_database_key  |
|REDIS_DB_PORT | 6379  |
|REDIS_DB_ENDPOINT | 127.0.0.1 |
|REDIS_DB_PASSWORD | rkkjg985e4jgw0t9jsgooiss  |

> **Note:** The Environmental Variable **REDIS_DB_PASSWORD** is only needed when you have access to a remote redis database server. If the value of **COVID_DATA_DB_KEYNAME** is not set, the value defaults to **covid19_data**. Also you can ignore **REDIS_DB_PORT**, **REDIS_DB_ENDPOINT**, and **REDIS_DB_PASSWORD** since it will default and connect your local installation of a Redis Server. Make sure to install redis locally to prevent any errors.

## 2. Start The Application

Once you have a cloned version of this repo on your computer, you can run `npm install` to install dependencies and then `npm run start` to start the application.

## 3. Set The Default Region

Once the application is running you can initialize and set the default country or region by visiting the URL:
  ------------------------------------
**127.0.0.1:[port]/covid/[your_country]**
  ------------------------------------
[port] is the port of the express server which is **5000** by default. You can change the value of the port in the **index.js** file. [your_country] is the full name of your country without any spaces.
**e.g:** *127.0.0.1:5000/covid/unitedstates*

> **Note:** You can set the default region or country **only!!! once**. Once you set the default country or region the data is cached in the Redis Database. Any subsequent visit to the same URL will result in a response of the cached version of the data. Also once the region or country is set trying to get data for a different country by visiting a different country will result in a redirect to the homepage. **You as an *API admin* or *Redis Server Admin* can only change the default country by deleting the data in the Redis Server and then visit the URL again with the new name of the country or region**. End users will only get a cached version of the data which is *wicked fast!!!*. 

Data is scheduled to be updated every hour by the help of the node.js package **node-cron**. 
> **Note:** You can change the update frequency value in **/utils/init.js** file.
